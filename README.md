Project Real Convertor Tool:


The scope:

This project will create a web application tool for doing conversions and calculations. This tool will enable the user to covert anything and everything in the scope of this project, for ex. volume, currencies, distance, weight, and etc... We will be using the converter api by converter.eu which will enable us to add all those those functionalities in one area. If the time permits, we will add more functionality to this web tool by adding things like financial, scientific, and graphing calculators. The idea is to help a user to convert and calculate to their hearts content in a given location.
